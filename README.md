# PyBer_Analysis
using Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis: 
To analyze all the rideshare data for the duration of January to early May of 2019 and create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

Various components analysed were segmented on the basis of city types : *Urban, Suburban and Rural*.

Ride-sharing data include the total rides, 
total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Below is the analysis :
Ride sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

- Total rides:
Urban = 1625, Suburban = 625 and Rural = 125

  ## Summary
  - It was observed that the fares for each city type reaches its peak during the end of the month of February. This can be due to imbalance of demand and supply of rides.

  - It was also seen that there is a big disparity between the number of rides and drivers available in rural cities, which in return becomes the reason for increased fares, which is evidently visible in average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 
  - Measures must be taken to curb this disparity and make affordable ride options for rural cities. Similar efforts are required in suburban cities as they become potential future major business prospects.
